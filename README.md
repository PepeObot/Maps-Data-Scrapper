As title says this is a maps data scrapper. Name, maps link, web page (If they have one), location, email (If site is found) and social (as in instagram, facebook).

It has 2 arguments commands when executing.
--loc: This makes the search of whatever category you want to look for in google maps. E.g: --loc Hotels (it accepts only 1 word)
--pl: Here you specify the location you want to look for. E.g: --pl Las Vegas.
It will make a .txt file with every place found in the search and its description.
